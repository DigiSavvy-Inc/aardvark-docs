## Most Accessibility Professionals Lose Their Initial Spark

 

At AAArdvark, we know that you’re passionate about accessibility and motivated to help the internet become a better place. You’re doing this one audit at a time, spreadsheet after spreadsheet.

The problem is that our current processes in the accessibility community are tedious and slow, which may make this whole internet a11y revolution feel unattainable. We believe reaching accessibility standards on the web shouldn’t be draining or monotonous. Trust us, we know what it feels like to deal with clients who don’t understand the importance of accessibility or when projects go way past the deadline, and it feels like they’ll never reach an end.

That’s why we decided to make an accessibility platform to help professionals complete full & thorough audits as fast as possible. With the Visual Mode feature, you can see the client’s live web pages and log issues in a fraction of the time it takes to do the same on a spreadsheet. With Team Management features, an entire team can track, assign, and discuss issues in real-time, so messy email threads are a thing of the past. And ongoing monitoring gives you and your client peace of mind that the work you’ve completed can last.

There’s nothing to lose; give AAArdvark a try for free so you can stop wasting time and effort on spreadsheets and instead focus on making the internet a better place (plus earn more money on the way!).

## Why Accessibility Matters

 

Web accessibility matters because it ensures that everyone, regardless of disability, can access and use the internet. Accessible websites and digital content ensure that people with visual, hearing, motor, or cognitive disabilities can have equal access to information, services, and products offered online. This promotes inclusion, diversity, and accessibility of digital content, which should be the core philosophy of any business. It optimizes a website for search engines, reduces legal risk, increases user engagement, and enhances user experience.

 

![](https://aaardvarkaccessibility.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2.-Inclusive-group-of-people-768x512.png) 

Additionally, making a website accessible ensures that it complies with legal and ethical standards, including the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), which can protect businesses from litigation and negative publicity. In summary, web accessibility is essential for ensuring that the internet remains an inclusive space for everyone, irrespective of their abilities.
