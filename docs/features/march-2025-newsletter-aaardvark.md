## Introduction

Spring is here, and we’ve got a lot of exciting updates for you! From new pricing plans to a simpler way to understand WCAG, this update is full of exciting news—plus a must-hear podcast, a new blog post, and an upcoming livestream.

Let’s dive in!

## New Pricing Officially Live

Our new pricing plans are live! It’s now easier than ever to get started with AAArdvark, whether you’re auditing a single site or managing multiple projects.

We’ve moved from individual site plans to flexible workspace pricing, making it easier to get started and more efficient for managing multiple sites. Our new plans are designed to fit the needs of as many accessibility professionals as possible, helping them seamlessly integrate AAArdvark into their workflows.

## WCAG in Plain English — Coming Soon!

Let’s be real: The WCAG guidelines are confusing. But look no further—AAArdvark is fixing that.

We’re on the brink of releasing our newest project, WCAG in Plain English. This new resource will break down every single WCAG success criterion into, well, plain English!

This has been a passion project for Natalie MacLees, the co-founder of AAArdvark, who’s wanted to rewrite WCAG for decades now. With that said, we’ve been hard at work simplifying every article in WCAG 2.2 A and AA for the last three years, and we’re finally ready to launch with what we have. But don’t worry; we’ll continue to work our way through AAA.

This free resource will live right on this website, and AAArdvark will link to these articles from the issues created in the app so they’re easily accessible.

We were thrilled by the overwhelming response on LinkedIn and can’t wait to share it with you. Stay tuned for the launch announcement!
