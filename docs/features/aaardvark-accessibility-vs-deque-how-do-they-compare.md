Deque, the creator of axe™ Monitor and axe™ Auditor, has significantly advanced web accessibility. Their tools are well-suited for enterprises looking for robust testing solutions. However, at AAArdvark, we saw the need for a more comprehensive toolkit tailored for freelancers, agencies, and teams focused on efficient remediation workflows.

 

Whether you’re an agency, freelancer, or product team, AAArdvark can enhance your accessibility service offerings and streamline remediation efforts.
