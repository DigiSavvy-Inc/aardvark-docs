Join Natalie and Natalie for the first episode of the AAArdvark Accessibility Podcast, where they share a quick introduction to digital accessibility.

Natalie G.: Hello, Natalie.

Natalie M.: Hello, Natalie.

Natalie G.: How are you doing, Natalie?

Natalie M.: I’m doing just fine, Natalie.

Natalie G.: Oh, I’m doing very well. Thank you for asking, Natalie. So, we’re here today to start the very first Accessibility Podcast episode. We’ll start with a quick introduction. I’m Natalie Garza, known as Natalie G., an accessibility novice and the mic MC here.

Natalie M.: I’m Natalie MacLees. I am an accessibility expert, and Natalie will interview me. And we’re both named Natalie—sorry if that’s confusing.

Natalie G.: Yes. All right, Natalie, let’s kick off the podcast. For this first episode, we wanted to start with a quick introduction to digital accessibility. What is digital accessibility? Give us a simple definition.

Natalie M.: Digital accessibility is ensuring that anybody can use your website or web application, regardless of what device they’re using, assistive technology, or their capacity as a person.

Natalie G.: What does digital accessibility apply to?

Natalie M.: Websites, web applications, and even native apps on mobile devices.

Natalie G.: Even desktop applications, right?

Natalie M.: Yep, desktop applications. It also applies to all kinds of digital machines—ATMs, kiosks, ticket machines for the subway—all of those things. Even self-checkout systems.

Natalie G.: Thank you. That was a great definition of digital accessibility. All right, next—who does digital accessibility benefit?

Natalie M.: Everyone. A lot of times, we think it just benefits people with disabilities, but it actually benefits everybody. Making a product accessible makes it easier to use.

We also tend to think of disability only in terms of permanent disabilities, but there are also temporary ones. For example, if you work on your computer a lot and break your wrist, using it would suddenly become very difficult, but it’s not permanent.

We’re constantly moving in and out of states of temporary disability—like being sick, having the flu, breaking a bone, or even spraining an ankle. Then there are situational disabilities, like trying to read your phone screen outside on a bright sunny day. Accessibility helps with all these situations.

Natalie G.: Are there other categories or groups who benefit?

Natalie M.: Besides everyone? Yes. Everybody gets older every day. As we age, we often struggle with mobility, dexterity, eyesight, and hearing. Accessibility ensures we can continue to use products.

Also, making your website accessible has SEO benefits. You’re essentially doing the same work to make your content understandable for assistive technologies and search engines. So, improving accessibility also boosts SEO.

Natalie G.: I have one more category for you.

Natalie M.: Okay.

Natalie G.: When you’re snacking at your computer, you’re temporarily disabled from using both hands.

Natalie M.: Both hands are shoving snacks in your mouth, and you have to use voice control. Or tabbing and using the spacebar—you’re making it work!

Natalie G.: Right, and you don’t want hot Cheeto dust on your keyboard.

Natalie M.: Exactly!

Natalie G.: So, digital accessibility benefits pretty much everyone. Now, why go through the effort of making things accessible for everyone?

Natalie M.: That was a very newscaster voice you had there.

Natalie G.: Thank you! It’s going to get better with every episode.

Natalie M.: Or more and more professional.

Natalie G.: Or less.

Natalie M.: Okay, better!

Natalie G.: Back to you, Natalie.

Natalie M.: First of all, people have a civil right to equal access to information and services. That’s the primary reason accessibility is important.

It also helps improve the user experience. Thoughtfully designing an accessible website or app improves the overall user experience. It can also boost performance and SEO.

Finally, there’s the legal aspect. Non-compliance with accessibility laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) can lead to lawsuits, which are costly and time-consuming. Many other countries have similar laws requiring accessibility.

Natalie G.: I have a curveball for you.

Natalie M.: Okay.

Natalie G.: Who’s responsible for accessibility?

Natalie M.: Everyone who works on your website. Not just developers or designers—content creators, editors, project managers, QA teams, social media teams, and business owners all play a role. Everyone needs to make sure their work is accessible.

Natalie G.: Perfect. That wraps up our episode introduction to digital accessibility. Where should someone new to accessibility start?

Natalie M.: If you’re new, visit AAArdvark and get your homepage scanned for free. We’ll show you accessibility issues and how to fix them. And, of course, subscribe to our podcast, where we’ll cover more accessibility topics.

Natalie G.: Thank you so much, Natalie, for this intro to digital accessibility. We covered what digital accessibility is, who it’s for, why it’s important, and who’s responsible. Join us for the next episode of the AAArdvark Accessibility Podcast to learn more!

Natalie M.: See you next time!

Natalie G.: Like and subscribe, and we’ll see you next time!
