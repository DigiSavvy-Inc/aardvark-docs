### Definitions

## Scope of the Service

AAArdvark is a cloud-based accessibility testing platform that helps users identify, track, and remediate accessibility issues on websites and digital content. The Service includes automated and manual accessibility testing tools, issue reporting, collaboration features, and compliance tracking for accessibility standards such as WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). AAArdvark does not guarantee legal compliance but provides tools to support accessibility efforts.

### User Responsibilities

The Service provides accessibility testing tools but does not guarantee full compliance with accessibility laws. It is Your responsibility to interpret the test results and implement accessibility recommendations appropriately.

## Acknowledgment

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on Your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms and Conditions. These Terms and Conditions apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.

By accessing or using the Service You agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If You disagree with any part of these Terms and Conditions then You may not access the Service.

Our Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of Your personal information when You use the Application or the Website and tells You about Your privacy rights and how the law protects You.

## Subscriptions

### Subscription period

The Service or some parts of the Service are available only with a paid Subscription. You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (such as daily, weekly, monthly or annually), depending on the type of Subscription plan you select when purchasing the Subscription.

At the end of each period, Your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless You cancel it or the Company cancels it.

### Subscription cancellations

You may cancel Your Subscription renewal either through Your Account settings page or by contacting the Company. Cancelation will prevent future charges but will not automatically result in a refund of any prepaid fees.

### Agency Plan

The Agency Plan allows agencies to pay a flat annual fee to add multiple client sites to their account without incurring one-time licensing fees per site. Agencies subscribing to the Agency Plan are responsible for:

### Billing

You shall provide the Company with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information as required.

Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, the Company will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.

### Fee Changes

The Company, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Subscription period.

The Company will provide You with reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give You an opportunity to terminate Your Subscription before such change becomes effective.

Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes Your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.

### Refunds

Except where required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable. The Company may, at its sole discretion, provide refunds or unused portions of prepaid subscriptions on a case-by-case basis. If You believe You are eligible for a refund, please contact support at [email protected].

### Free Trial

The Company may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a Free Trial for a limited period of time.

You may be required to enter Your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.

If You do enter Your billing information when signing up for a Free Trial, You will not be charged by the Company until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless You cancelled Your Subscription, You will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription You have selected.

At any time and without notice, the Company reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.

## Fair Use Policy

The Fair Use Policy is designed to ensure that all users receive high-quality and consistent service. Excessive or unreasonable use of the service may affect AAArdvark’s ability to provide its services to other customers.

### Definition of Excessive Use

Excessive use is defined as usage that significantly exceeds the average usage by other Agency Plan subscribers. This may include, but is not limited to, adding an unusually high number of sites, generating excessive automated scans, or consuming system resources in a way that disrupts the service for other users.

### Monitoring and Enforcement

AAArdvark reserves the right to monitor usage patterns to identify excessive use. At its sole discretion, AAArdvark may determine that an account exceeds fair usage limits. If an account is determined to be in violation of these limits:

## Limitation of Liability

Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of its suppliers under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven’t purchased anything through the Service.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.

Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each party’s liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.

## Service Availability

While we strive to ensure uninterrupted availability of the Service, we do not guarantee that the Service will be available at all times. Temporary interruptions may occur due to maintenance, upgrades, network failures, or other unforeseen circumstances. The Company is not liable for any downtime, data loss, or disruptions to Your use of the Service.

Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.

Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company’s provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the Service, or the information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content provided through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.

If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.

### Waiver
