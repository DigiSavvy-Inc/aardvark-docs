									As a digital professional with over 25 years of experience, I have developed a strong commitment to inclusivity and a desire to help other digital professionals build an internet that is accessible to everyone.

Now, with AAArdvark, I’m proud to offer a suite of tools that helps make accessibility easier and faster while still maintaining high quality of work. AAArdvark does not offer a misleading quick-fix overlay, but rather offers tools for designers, developers, and accessibility professionals to quickly and easily identify, track, and fix accessibility issues on websites.
