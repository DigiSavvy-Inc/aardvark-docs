# Automated Scans

 

## Introduction

AAArdvark provides automated scans to help quickly identify straightforward accessibility issues on your site.

The automated accessibility scans are a great way to speed up the auditing process because you won’t have to scan for these smaller instances and AAArdvark can also detect when these issues are resolved.

### Accessibility Scan Notice

Note: Like all automated scanners, AAArdvark’s accessibility scanner is not comprehensive and may not identify every issue on your site. The Automated Scans are only a great starting point for an audit, where a professional can then come in and perform a full and thorough manual audit to find the rest of the issues.

## Automated Scans

Automated scans can be scheduled to run regularly or triggered manually with a single click.

Any new errors or warnings found in the scans will be added to the Issues list.

### Scheduled Automated Scans

During the initial site configuration, you selected a ‘Scan Frequency’ option: Manual Only, Weekly, or Daily.

If you need to change this, you can always head to the Site Dashboard > Settings tab and change the Scan Frequency option from there.

### Manual Automated Scans

You can run one manual automated scan at a time. There are several ways to run manual automated scans for your site.

#### Whole Site Manual Automated Scans

To run a manual scan for a site, navigate to the Site Dashboard, then click Run Automated Scan. This action will initiate a new scan, and the Activity Log will update with the scan’s progress.
