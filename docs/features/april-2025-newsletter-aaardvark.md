## Fresh Growth and New Launches This Spring

Spring is in full swing, and so are we. From major product updates to fresh resources and upcoming events, this month is all about growth—both in the platform and in the accessibility community.

We’re especially excited to share the official launch of WCAG in Plain English, a project years in the making that’s now part of AAArdvark. Whether you’re tuning into our latest podcast, checking out the new blog, or joining us live at AccessU, we hope you’ll find something in here to inspire your next steps toward better digital accessibility.

## WCAG in Plain English: Now Live!

Our biggest update this month is that WCAG in Plain English is now live and fully integrated into AAArdvark!

This is a collection of WCAG articles translated into plain language to help teams and clients who aren’t familiar with accessibility better understand the success criteria and how to implement them. It’s designed to make audits, remediation, and accessibility projects easier to navigate.

The AAArdvark team spent three years and countless hours creating this free resource for the community. We hope this can be a big step toward helping more website owners and non-technical folks appreciate digital accessibility work and its mission.

We hope you find it helpful! Feel free to bookmark it and use it in your next project!

Our latest blog post breaks down what the law covers, who needs to comply, and how to prepare before the June 2025 deadline.
