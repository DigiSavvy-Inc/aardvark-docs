# WCAG in Plain English Credits and Acknowledgments

 

WCAG in Plain English is a project by AAArdvark, created to make the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) easier to understand and apply. We believe accessibility should be approachable for everyone, not just experts, and we’re grateful to the community whose work helped shape this resource.

## Adapted Content and Attributions

While all the article content in WCAG in Plain English is original and was written by our team to clearly explain each success criterion, we gratefully built on the ideas, summaries, and frameworks shared by others in the accessibility community. These contributions helped us organize the content, identify meaningful relationships, and improve the clarity and navigability of the site.

We’ve listed all sources of inspiration and adaptation below, with full attribution and links where available.

We are thankful for the creators who generously shared their work under open licenses, allowing us to build on their efforts.

### Martin Underhill – WCAG, but in language I can understand

We used Martin Underhill’s excellent WCAG in language I can understand blog series as a reference for the one-sentence summaries introducing each success criterion. These short explanations were clear, approachable, and aligned with our mission to make WCAG more accessible to everyone.

Martin’s original posts include:

While all article content in WCAG in Plain English was written by our team, we felt Martin’s work helped set the tone and direction for each success criterion and were used to provide quick at-a-glance summaries.

### UK Government Digital Service – GOV.UK WCAG Primer

Adapted in part from the GOV.UK WCAG Primer, licensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0.We referenced this material when developing clear, practical explanations for WCAG success criteria.
