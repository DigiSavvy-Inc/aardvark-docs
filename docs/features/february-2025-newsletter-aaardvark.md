Recent policy changes in the US have been discouraging for those of us working toward a more accessible and inclusive world. But accessibility has always been about persistence, progress, and showing up for those who need it most.

As the saying goes: “If this is the world with us, I don’t want to see the world without us.”

Now more than ever, our work matters. We remain committed to making accessibility easier, more effective, and more widespread. Let’s keep pushing forward—together.

In the spirit of optimism and persistence, here’s what we’ve been up to this month.

## ​​Pricing Update Coming Soon

AAArdvark will be transitioning to a monthly subscription model to provide continuous improvements and better align with industry standards. If you’re an existing customer, we’ll be reaching out soon with details. Have questions? We’re happy to chat!

## Need Accessible PDFs? We Can Help!

The AAArdvark team is now offering PDF remediation at a flat rate of $10 per page! PDF accessibility remediation involves making a PDF document compliant with accessibility standards (like WCAG and PDF/UA) so that it’s usable by people with disabilities.

If you have PDFs that need to be accessible, reach out to our support team.

## The Accessibility Audit Trap

“An audit doesn’t make a website accessible. Fixing accessibility issues does.“

If your accessibility efforts feel stuck in an endless loop of audits without real progress, it’s time to shift gears. Our latest article breaks down why audits alone won’t solve the problem and how to move from simply identifying issues to actively fixing them.
