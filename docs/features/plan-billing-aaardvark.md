## Change Site Plans

You can upgrade or downgrade your site plan anytime, with changes taking effect immediately. Any adjustments to your billing—prorated increases or decreases—will be reflected in your next invoice.

To change your plan, go to the Workspace Plan section and click Manage to select a new plan. Review the changes, and add coupon codes before completing the Checkout. If you haven’t entered a credit card before, pressing Checkout will prompt for this information afterwards.

### Downgrading Plans

When downgrading, ensure your workspace page and site count fit within the new plan’s limit. If it exceeds the limit, you’ll be prompted to remove extra pages or sites before the change can be made.

## Update Billing Information

Under the Payment Information section, the credit card you currently have on file is displayed here.

To update your payment method, click Update Billing in the Payment Information section. Enter your new card details, which will replace the existing card on file for all future invoices.
