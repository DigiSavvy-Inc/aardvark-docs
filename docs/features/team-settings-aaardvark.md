# Team Settings

 

## Introduction

Each Workspace has a single Owner, but you can add as many Users as needed. Users are assigned roles to manage their permissions, and once added, they must be assigned to a Team to access specific websites.

Teams in AAArdvark help you control which users can access specific sites within your Workspace.

For example, agencies can grant clients access to their own sites while keeping other sites private. Teams are also ideal for organizing multiple development groups, ensuring they only see the sites they manage.

To manage teams and users, click your name in the top-right corner of the AAArdvark interface > click Manage Workspace > and click the Team menu item.

Once the team option is open, use this page to:

Note: If no team members have been invited to the Workspace yet, the Teams menu will not appear.

## What are Teams?

Teams links Users to specific Sites. Only users in a Team can view the sites assigned to that Team.

Users could include a variety of different people including:

### User Roles

When adding a new User to your Workspace, you’ll also need to select a User Role to assign them. The Role will determine their level of access and permissions within your Workspace.

The User Role does not change across Teams – their permission level is the same regardless of what website they’re assigned to.

Once the user is added to the Workspace, you’ll see a pop-up confirming that.
