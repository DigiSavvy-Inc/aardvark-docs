## Introduction

AAArdvark Generic Webhooks lets you automate accessibility scans by triggering them through third-party services or during your deployment process. By sending a GET or POST request to a secure Webhook URL, you can seamlessly integrate AAArdvark into your workflows.

For instance, you can set your deployment script to call the webhook URL immediately after deploying a new version of your site. This ensures your website is automatically checked for accessibility issues right away.

Pro Tip: This feature is especially useful for complex sites with longer deployment times.

Copy the Webhook URL and save it securely – you’ll need this to connect AAArdvark to your third-party service or script. Once copied, click Add to finalize the webhook setup.
