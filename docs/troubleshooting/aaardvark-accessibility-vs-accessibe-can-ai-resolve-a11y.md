## How Does AAArdvark Compare to AI Accessibility Widgets?

AI-powered accessibility widgets, such as accessiBe, claim to provide quick fixes for accessibility compliance by simply installing a JavaScript snippet. While these tools are marketed as effortless solutions, the reality is more complex.

Compliance with WCAG standards requires thoughtful human effort, expertise, and meaningful problem-solving. Automated tools cannot address the nuanced challenges that arise when making a website accessible for all users, including those with physical or cognitive disabilities.

If you’re considering an automated solution, it’s crucial to consult your legal counsel to understand whether such tools provide genuine protection from demand letters and lawsuits in the U.S.

 

The Alternative?

Meet AAArdvark, a platform designed to empower human experts in achieving true WCAG compliance and delivering a superior user experience.
