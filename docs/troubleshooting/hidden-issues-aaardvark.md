# Hidden Issues

 

## Introduction

AAArdvark scans your site to identify accessibility issues and uses Visual Mode to display their exact coordinates on the page. However, there are some outliers and exceptions to this, such as Hidden Issues.

## What Are Hidden Issues?

Hidden Issues are issues that AAArdvark can detect but that are not visible on the page as you are currently viewing it. If you try to look at these issues in Visual Mode, you’ll find them under the Hidden category and clicking an issue will not take you to the spot on the page where the element is located. This happens because the tool cannot pinpoint the location of these issues on the current screen.

There are a number of reasons an element might be hidden:

In these cases, the issues exist but cannot be pinpointed visually due to the lack of onscreen coordinates.

## Viewing All Issues

When viewing the text list of issues, all issues will be there. However, when you try to switch to Visual Mode, you may notice that some issues appear as if they’re missing. These are the aforementioned hidden issues, and they won’t be visible on the page.

To view all the issues, switch to Visual Mode and click the Issues tab. From the pop-up that displays, you can view both the Visible and the Hidden tabs. All hidden issues will be listed in the Hidden section, and just like Visible issues, they will each have their own severity marked accordingly.
