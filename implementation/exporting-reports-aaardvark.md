# Exporting Reports

 

## Introduction

AAArdvark’s reporting feature makes it easy to review and share accessibility scan details for your site. Reports are available as PDF or xlsx (spreadsheet) files, providing summaries of scan results, issues, and WCAG compliance.

AAArdvark’s reports are tailored to meet your needs. Choose a PDF report for a concise visual summary or choose a xlsx report for detailed, sortable data.

## Running a Scan

Before generating a report, make sure to run an automated scan. Once the scan is complete, report download options will appear in your Site Dashboard.

## Downloading the Report

To download a report, go to the Site Dashboard and find the PDF and xlsx buttons below the site’s information. Click the button for your preferred format. Once the report is ready, the button will change to say, ‘PDF/Excel file is ready to download.’ Simply click again to download the file.
