### Site Folders

On the sidebar, a list of all the sites that have been added to the workspace are displayed. Each site in the sidebar represents a folder containing tools and settings specific to that site. Click a site name to expand its menu and access its Site Dashboard, where you can manage pages, run scans, and more.

## Site Dashboard

The Site Dashboard looks a little different from the Workspace dashboard. From here, you’ll be able to run scans, view scan results, display recent activity, access Visual Mode, modify pages, and more.
