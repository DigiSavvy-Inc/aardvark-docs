## About the Founder

 

As a digital professional with over 25 years of experience, I’ve had the privilege of helping shape the web as we know it today. Early in my career, I worked at Penn State University, where I developed a deep commitment to inclusivity and accessibility.

Throughout my journey, I’ve trained countless developers and designers to incorporate accessibility into their work. Now, with AAArdvark, I’m proud to offer a platform that helps make auditing easier and faster while maintaining the highest quality standards.

AAArdvark is not a quick-fix overlay. It’s a comprehensive accessibility testing tool for designers, developers, and accessibility professionals to identify, track, and fix issues effectively – empowering teams to build a better, more inclusive web.
