# Visual Mode

 

## Introduction

Visual Mode is an innovative feature that makes identifying and resolving accessibility issues easy. By providing real-time visual feedback, it helps you spot issues directly on your website.

## Installing the Browser Extension

To use Visual Mode, you’ll need to install the AAArdvark browser extension. This allows the platform to connect to your site and enable the visual interface for identifying and recording accessibility issues. Follow these steps to get started:

You’re now ready to access Visual Mode and start auditing your site!

## Visual Mode

To access Visual Mode:

Important: If you haven’t run a scan on the site yet, Visual Mode will not be accessible. Be sure to run a scan first.

## Show Issues

The Show Issues toggle helps you identify accessibility issues directly on the page:

Tip: Use the toggle to switch between reviewing issues and exploring the site.

## Errors and Warnings

The icons on your page represent Errors and Warnings, each identified by specific colors and icons. If you have enabled Notices in your site settings, you’ll also see icons for the Notices.

Errors are categorized by severity, from critical issues to minor inconveniences.

You can click each icon and see issues filtered by severity.

### Viewing The Issues

Much like viewing the details of an issue from a scan, you can also modify the issue in Visual Mode, change who it is assigned to, and comment on the issue.

## Recording an Issue

Manually record accessibility issues using Visual Mode to capture anything automated scans may miss.
